<p class="text-unten">Step into a world where innocence thrives amidst collapse. Tommorows Playground presents a haunting yet tender series of photographs that explore the lives of children growing up in a speculative future—one shaped by environmental degradation, climate disasters, and humanity’s neglect. From birthday celebrations on polluted shores to quiet moments of play in abandoned ruins, the series captures the contrast between the unyielding joy of childhood and the tragic landscapes they inhabit.
</p>
  <p>What does it mean to find happiness in the ruins of our own making? Are these children resilient, oblivious, or simply adapting to a new normal? The exhibition invites you to reflect on the consequences of our collective apathy, challenging you to see the beauty, absurdity, and horror of a future that might already be unfolding. <br> <br>
    Are you ready to confront the laughter that echoes through the wreckage?
